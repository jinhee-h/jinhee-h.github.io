          <div class="exp-body">
            <p class="desc">I've worked with people in the outdoor heated NPD team at SharkNinja Headquarters to bring their products to the market. 
              I've iterated on CAD models to come up with cost-effective solutions and used various shop tools to rapid-prototype different ideas. 
              Some products I've worked on include the propane-based Firepit, the outdoor barbeque grill, and an unreleased firepit + grill product.</p>
            
            <p class="desc">The main product I've worked on during my time at SharkNinja is the Firepit. 
              The skills I've acquired through working on this product include CAD modeling, 3D printing, and rapid-prototyping in the shop.
            I've helped iterate on the user interface, the door, the feet, and the valve positionings in an effort to cut costs during production.</p>
            
            <p class="desc">One example is the UI (seen in the photo). The UI is in a vertical set-up, which costs more per unit to produce due to the way the valves are managed inside.
            To try and fix this issue, I've been tasked to make a horizontal UI, with the 2 dials that you can see in the photo as well as incorporate an additional ignition module
             which would also save more costs. One problem I've faced is that the 3d printed UI looked and felt very fragile due to the curvature of the firepit.
             To accomodate for this issue, I've iterated on the CAD model to make the interface flat, so that the dials feel more secure in place. 
            Through this specific challenge, I've gained more experience in CAD modeling, 3D printing, Rapid-Prototyping, and general engineering thinking in an fast-paced environment.</p>
