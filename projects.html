            <p class="desc">Ths project was a solo project I began back in high school. 
              What started out as a passion and obsession in Star Wars taught me lots of valuable technical and soft skills in the field of mechanical engineering. 
              The build is not quite done, and the last steps include assembling the electronic components so that the lightsaber can actually light up using a doublesided LED strip.</p>
            <p class="desc">I've learned to use the dremel to cut metal, file, grind, sand, drill, tap, measure on cylindrical surfaces, 3d print, and come up with creative workarounds.
            In terms of soft skills, I've learned to source parts from vendors and other collectors, extensive research and risk management, negotiations, networking, budgeting, and solution-based thinking.</p>
            <p class="desc">One problem I ran into while working on this project was drilling and tapping for the perfectly even six screws on the top half of the hilt.
            To solve this problem, I reached out to a friend's dad who had much experience in various shoptools, who was kind enough to guide me step by step in how to punch, drill, and tap these kinds of screws.
            Through this, I gained valuable insights on metalworking, and this improved my general engineering thinking in a broad sense, as it gave me an idea of how exprienced engineers take on problems in the real world.</p>
